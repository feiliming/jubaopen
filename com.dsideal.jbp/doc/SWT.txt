Operating system resources in SWT refer to native resources used by those (operating system) resourcebased objects, 
e.g. Display, Color, Font, GC, Image, Printer, Region, and Widgets. Most of the classes in the following packages are resource-based:
org.eclipse.swt.custom
org.eclipse.swt.graphics
org.eclipse.swt.widgets
You can check whether a class has a dispose() method. If it does, then it is very likely resource-based. Otherwise, it isn't.
1.If you created it, you dispose it.
2.Disposing the parent disposes the children.
